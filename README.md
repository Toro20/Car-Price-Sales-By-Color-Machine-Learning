# Car-Price-Sales-By-Color-Machine-Learning
Python Jupyter Notebooks Application that takes an input of car sales and calculates how many cars will sell in future years based off of their colors.
This project takes the input as a csv file, preprocesses the data, and then makes a prediction using the machine learning model. This machine learning model uses linear regression in order to make its prediction.

Once the sales have been predicted, the data is gathered and mapped into different charts for readability.

# Accuracy
The accuracy of the machine learning models predictions can also be tested. In order to test its accuracy, the model must be provided with the real sales data, and then be compared with its predicted sales data. 
Depending on the data provided, the model returned an accuracy from anywhere between 80-90%, however, the accuracy is very dependent on the amount of data the model is trained on.
